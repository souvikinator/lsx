# ❓ Why?

It's a pain to `cd` and `ls` multiple times to reach desired directory in terminal (_this maybe subjective_). **ls-Xtended (lsx)** solves this problem by allowing users to smoothly navigate and search directories on the go with just one command. It also allows to create alias for paths making it easier for users to remember the path to the desired directory.

**It also ranks your directories based on how often you access them and placing them on top of the list to reduce searching and navigation time.**

> **NOTE**: to know more about the ranking algorithm head over [here](https://github.com/souvikinator/lsx/blob/master/utils/rank.go)

# 💻 Demo

> **Note**: once you reach the desired destination, use `ctr+c` to exit and stay in the desired destination

## Navigate through terminal and perform search:

- use `/` to trigger search and start typing to search

> _Notice how directories gets ranked._

```bash
ls-x
```

## Show hidden files as well

```bash
ls-x -a
```

![ls-x](https://github.com/souvikinator/lsx/blob/master/assets/all-mode.gif)

## Set **alias** for directory paths

```bash
ls-x set-alias -n somealias -p path/to/be/aliased
```

or

```bash
ls-x set-alias --path-name somealias --path path/to/be/aliased
```

## Updating Alias

`set-alias` can also be used to update any existing alias. Let's say alias `abc` already exists for path `a/b/c`. on can update it like so:

```bash
ls-x set-alias -n abc -p d/e/f
```

## List **alias** created by user

```bash
ls-x alias
```

![ls-x](https://github.com/souvikinator/lsx/blob/master/assets/list-alias.gif)

## Use **alias**

```bash
ls-x somealias
```

![ls-x](https://github.com/souvikinator/lsx/raw/master/assets/use-alias.gif)

## Remove existing **alias**

```bash
ls-x remove-alias aliasname
```

# ⚗️ Install

> ## **Note**: make sure to have Go installed and your GOPATH is added to [PATH](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21001387/how-do-i-set-the-gopath-environment-variable-on-ubuntu-what-file-must-i-edit)

### Step-1:

Clone the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/souvikinator/lsx.git`

### Step-2:

> `cd lsx`

> `chmod u+x install.sh`

> `sudo ./install.sh`

and you are ready to go, restart your terminal. Enjoy!

**Note**: **zsh**, **bash** and **fish** shell users just need to run the installation script and lsx will be ready to use. In case the command is not working add following line at the end of your shell resource file (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`...):

`source ~/.config/lsx/lsx.sh`

and then restart your terminal

**open an issue if still facing installation problems**

## How to update?

Go inside the cloned directory and add use following command:

```bash
git pull origin master
```

and then:

```bash
./install.sh
```

restart your terminal and you are good to go.

# ❗Known Issues

As of now the installation process is painful and the reason is a program runs as a child process in a terminal so eveything happens withing that child process. When we change the directory from go program the directory changes for that executable or to be specific "for that child process" and not of the shell. Which is why one needs to source a script in their shell resource file (`.zshrc`, `.bashrc`...).

The script contains a bash function as a wrapper around the lsx binary to make the whole `cd` thing work. This is what is prevent lsx to be distributed using some package manager.

If anyone can comeup with something then feel free to open issue.
